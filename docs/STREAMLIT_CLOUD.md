# Streamlit Cloud Deployment

## Deployment Contract
- Entrypoint: `dashboard/app.py`
- Runtime: `python-3.11` in [runtime.txt](../runtime.txt)
- Runtime dependencies: [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)
- Streamlit version: `1.54.0`

## Operational Principles
- Keep exactly one runtime dependency source for the deployed app.
- Treat Python version as a deployment contract, not as a best-effort preference.
- Validate the dashboard as a product surface after each deploy, not only dependency installation.

## Repository Readiness
- Keep `.streamlit/config.toml` at the repository root.
- Keep `.streamlit/secrets.toml` out of git; use `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml` as the template.
- Keep demo datasets under `data/sample/` available for smoke tests and fallbacks.

## App Creation Settings
- Repository: `samuelmaia-analytics/data-senior-analytics`
- Branch: `main`
- Main file path: `dashboard/app.py`
- Python version: `3.11`

## Local Pre-Deploy Checks
```bash
python -m ruff check src config scripts dashboard tests
python -m black --line-length 100 --target-version py311 --check src config scripts dashboard tests
python -m pytest
python scripts/check_encoding.py
python scripts/streamlit_cloud_preflight.py
python scripts/validate_data_provenance.py
python scripts/generate_data_manifest.py --check
```

## Smoke Test Checklist
1. Open the deployed URL.
2. Confirm `Overview` renders without tracebacks.
3. Confirm `Overview` shows decision risk, confidence, and release posture.
4. Navigate through `Upload`, `Data`, `EDA`, `Visualizations`, `Database`, and `Settings`.
5. Upload a CSV/XLSX and confirm the quality score updates.
6. If personal data is detected, confirm previews are masked and persistence asks for acknowledgement.
7. Save the curated dataset into SQLite and confirm it appears in `Database`.

## Troubleshooting
- App still starts with `Python 3.14.x`:
  Delete the app and recreate it with `Python 3.11`.
- Dependencies install but the app crashes on startup:
  Check Streamlit API compatibility between the deployed version and the codebase.
- Streamlit Cloud warns about multiple dependency sources:
  The repository should expose runtime dependencies only through `requirements.txt`.
