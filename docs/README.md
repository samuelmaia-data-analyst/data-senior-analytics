## What Changed in the Current Product Surface
- The dashboard now exposes a decision brief, trust level, and release posture in `Overview`.
- Governance is visible in the UI through freshness, source, transformation count, and quality status.
- The analytics layer now produces both business concentration signals and operational confidence signals.
- Privacy controls are now visible through masking, LGPD risk signals, and safer persistence defaults.

## ADRs

## Documentation Standard
- Prefer operational clarity over generic description.
- Keep business-facing language explicit when a document influences decision-making.
- Keep runtime, data quality, and governance guidance aligned with the deployed system.
